1. Read in targeted SST. Save as T_0
2. Read in k-th run of SST. Save as T
3. Read in k-th run of qflux. Saved as q
3. If k == 0 then set uniform SST-qflux sensitivity S to some constant.
4. If k >  0 then read in S map.
5. Calculate offset dT = T - T_0
6. Calculate adjusted qflux q_adj = q - dT / S
7. Output qflux file.
